We compared such information with a compilation of independent distributional data from natural history collections and other sources. Location Europe. Methods We used data for the hawkmoths (Lepidoptera, family Sphingidae) to assess three aspects of range information: (1) observed range filling in 100 km 9 100 km grid cell squares, (2) observed European range extent and (3) observed climatic niche. Range extents were calculated as products of latitu- dinal and longitudinal extents. Areas derived from minimum convex polygons drawn onto a 2-dimensional niche space representing the two main axes of a principal component analysis (PCA) were used to calculate climatic niche space. Additionally, record-based permutation tests for niche differences were carried out. Results We found that GBIF provided many more distribution records than independent compilation efforts, but contributed less information on range filling, range extent and climatic niches of species. Main conclusions Although GBIF contributed relevant additional information, it is not yet an effective alternative to manual compilation and databasing of distributional records from collections and literature sources, at least in lesser- known taxa such as invertebrates. We discuss possible reasons for our findings, which may help shape GBIF strategies for providing more informative data.},

But estimates of species richness for a given place are often imprecise and incomplete, even when derived from expert-validated range maps. The current uptake of citizen science in natural resource management, conservation, and ecology offers great potential for extensive data to define species occurrence and richness patterns in the future. Yet, studies are needed to validate these richness patterns and ensure these data are fit-for-purpose. We compared data from a continental-scale citizen science project\textemdash FrogID\textemdash with expert-derived range maps to assess how well the former predicts species richness patterns in space. We then investigated how many citizen science submissions are necessary to fully sample the underlying frog community. There was a strong positive association between citizen science species richness estimates and estimates derived from an expert-derived map of frog distributions. An average of 153 citizen science submissions were necessary to fully-sample frog richness based on the expert-derived frog richness. Sampling effort in the citizen science project was negatively correlated with the remoteness of an area: less remote areas were more likely to have a greater number of citizen science submissions and be fully sampled. This suggests that scientists will likely need to rely on professionals for data collection in remote regions. We conclude that a citizen science project that has been running for {$\sim$} 18 months, can accurately predict frog species richness at a continental scale compared with an expert-derived map based on {$\sim$} 240 years of data accumulation. At large-scales, biodiversity data derived from citizen science projects will likely play a prominent role in the future of biodiversity and conservation.},

Location Mediterranean islands. Methods We gathered data on reptile richness from 974 islands, assuming better sampling in islands with specific inventories. We used Moran's eigenvector mapping to analyse the factors that determine whether an island has been surveyed, and to identify the relationships between reptile richness, geographical parameters and anthropic parameters.We simulated islands, mimicking patterns of true data, and sampled them with varying effort. Simulated richness was analysed using the same approach used for real-world data. Results The probability that islands were sampled for reptiles was higher in large, human-populated islands. The relationship between human impact and reptile richness was negative in well-surveyed islands, but positive in islands that had not been systematically surveyed, because densely populated and accessible islands receive better sampling. In simulations, analyses successfully retrieved the relation- ships between species richness and human presence only if the average species detection probability was {$\geq$}75\%. Poorer sampling resulted in biased regression results. Main conclusions Human activities may strongly affect biodiversity, but human presence and accessibility improve sampling effort and thus the quality of biodi- versity information. Therefore, regressing known species richness on parameters representing human presence may result in apparent positive relationships. These two facets of human presence (positive on biodiversity knowledge, negative on actual biodiversity) represent a major challenge for ecogeographical studies, as not taking them into account would bias analyses and underestimate human impact},

However, despite recent efforts to gather two centuries of biodiversity inventories into comprehensive databases, many crucial research questions remain unanswered. Here, we update the concept of knowledge shortfalls and review the tradeoffs between generality and uncertainty. We present seven key shortfalls of current biodiversity data. Four previously proposed shortfalls pinpoint knowledge gaps for species taxonomy (Linnean), distribution (Wallacean), abundance (Prestonian), and evolutionary patterns (Darwinian). We also redefine the Hutchinsonian shortfall to apply to the abiotic tolerances of species and propose new shortfalls relating to limited knowledge of species traits (Raunki\ae ran) and biotic interactions (Eltonian). We conclude with a general framework for the combined impacts and consequences of shortfalls of large-scale biodiversity knowledge for evolutionary and ecological research and consider ways of overcoming the seven shortfalls and dealing with the uncertainty they generate.},

  abstract = {news and update ISSN 1948-6596 commentary Mapping species distributions: living with uncertainty decreases with time because of range changes associated with factors such as climate and land- use change, habitat degradation, biological inva- sions, etc. Moreover, changes in taxonomic status resulting from reclassifications (Hey et al. 2003) may mean that even if the assemblage remains unchanged, the quality of the information de- grades. Thus, the utility and accuracy of informa- tion about species occurrences to describe current distributions depends upon when the database is consulted. This process of information decay also applies to data based on expert assessments, such as range maps, which are ultimately based on knowledge coming from surveys and observa- tions. Finally, the decay in community similarity with increasing geographic distances is a well known pattern in biogeography (Nekola \& White 1999). The main drivers of this pattern are envi- ronmental gradients (e.g. climate, soil chemistry, etc.), spatial configuration of habitats and popula- tion aggregation (Morlon et al. 2008). Species dis- tribution maps are typically based on the spatial extrapolation of survey data through expert as- sessment or species distribution modeling (Rocchini et al. 2011). It follows that their accu- racy for unsurveyed regions will decrease with distance from the original samples, and (in the absence of comprehensive coverage of the study area) our knowledge about the actual distribution of the species may be poor. The proposed Map of Life project aspires to create a type of omniscient GIS for all the Earth's living species \textendash{} such as the one imagined by Colwell \& Coddington (1994). This is a wonderful target, with the potential to dramatically improve the spatial and temporal resolution of biodiversity data. Nevertheless, the biodiversity data that un- derpin any such enterprise have intrinsic and un- avoidable limitations that result in loss of knowl- edge over both time and space. This is well known A recent paper by Jetz et al. (2012) presents the `Map of Life', a web-based tool that aims to pro- vide a representation of the distribution of every species on Earth 1 . This database, if it is fully real- ized, would provide an invaluable resource for the advancement of biogeographical research, in addi- tion to its potential utility for conservation plan- ning. As most biogeographers, we would give al- most unconditional support to any initiatives that may improve the quantity, quality and availability of species distribution data \textendash{} such as the Map of Life, GBIF 2 , Encyclopedia of Life 3 , etc. (see review in Riddle et al. 2010). We are certain that they will provide a deeper and wider knowledge about life on Earth through the uprising field of biodiversity informatics (see Sober\'on \& Peterson 2004). Even so, it is important to bear in mind that there are intrinsic limitations to the quality, longevity and coverage of biodiversity data. There are at least three factors that com- promise the quality of our knowledge of species distributions at any given spatial scale: survey completeness, and the decay of information with time and space. First, as any field ecologist knows, many taxa are difficult to detect because of their phenotype (cryptic coloration and behavior, high mobility, phenology, etc.) and the characteristics of the habitat. Thus, most biological surveys on which species distribution maps are based are un- avoidably incomplete, even when a range of sam- pling methodologies is utilized (Colwell \& Cod- dington 1994). In other words, it is normally im- possible to record the entire assemblage for a de- fined area at a given moment of time. Moreover, the completeness of a sample will typically de- crease with increasing extent of the survey area (see Chiarucci et al. 2011). Second, knowledge about species distribu- tions and the composition of local assemblages is in a constant state of information decay.

In this study, we explore what hampers dataset retrieval in biodiversity research, a field that produces a large amount of heterogeneous data. In particular, we focus on scholarly search interests and metadata, the primary source of data in a dataset retrieval system. We show that existing metadata currently poorly reflect information needs and therefore are the biggest obstacle in retrieving relevant data. Our findings indicate that for data seekers in the biodiversity domain environments, materials and chemicals, species, biological and chemical processes, locations, data parameters and data types are important information categories. These interests are well covered in metadata elements of domain-specific standards. However, instead of utilizing these standards, large data repositories tend to use metadata standards with domain-independent metadata fields that cover search interests only to some extent. A second problem are arbitrary keywords utilized in descriptive fields such as title, description or subject. Keywords support scholars in a full text search only if the provided terms syntactically match or their semantic relationship to terms used in a user query is known.},

  abstract = {Aim: Biodiversity information is the focus of major initiatives aimed at assembling large-scale primary-data documentation ('digital accessible knowledge') of the distribution of life on Earth. Recent efforts within Brazil have assembled a massive amount of such documentation for Brazilian plants, which we analyse in this study. Our aim is to identify areas representing gaps in current knowledge; these gaps can guide future botanical exploration and discovery in Brazil. Location: Brazil. Methods: We assessed angiosperm inventories across Brazil at diverse spatial scales using statistics that summarize inventory completeness. In particular, we assess the completeness of geographical knowledge of Brazilian floras as measured in terms of geographical distance and climatic difference from well-documented sites. Results: Spatial knowledge of Brazilian angiosperms is very unevenly distributed: well-known sites are concentrated in eastern and southern regions, whereas the remainder of the country remains poorly documented. Worse still, in many regions, areas lacking detailed botanical documentation coincide with areas of intense habitat destruction, such that many such sites will never be documented scientifically. Main conclusions: This study illustrates how biodiversity survey and inventory efforts can be guided by existing knowledge. That is, to the extent that existing biodiversity knowledge is made digital and openly available, and to the extent that information is sufficiently comprehensive and informative, spatial summaries of completeness such as that presented here offer clear and strategic directions for maximizing the yield of new knowledge from any de novo field efforts. \textcopyright{} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

While the effects of biased spatial coverage of biodiversity data are relatively well known, temporal variation in data quality (i.e., the congruence between recorded and actual information) has received much less attention. Here, we develop a conceptual framework for understanding the influence of time on biodiversity data quality based on three main processes: (1) the natural dynamics of ecological systems\textemdash such as species turnover or local extinction; (2) periodic taxonomic revisions, and; (3) the loss of physical and metadata due to inefficient curation, accidents, or funding shortfalls. Temporal decay in data quality driven by these three processes has fundamental consequences for the usage and comparability of data collected in different time periods. Data decay can be partly ameliorated by adopting standard protocols for generation, storage, and sharing data and metadata. However, some data degradation is unavoidable due to natural variations in ecological systems. Consequently, changes in biodiversity data quality over time need be carefully assessed and, if possible, taken into account when analyzing aging datasets.},

He travelled extensively in Europe, carried out scientific explorations across the Russian Empire and in Latin America, and devoted much energy to seeking a unified view of the different branches of scientific knowledge. Ansichten der Natur, published in 1808 with a second edition in 1826, aimed to 'engage the imagination' as well as to communicate new ideas, and was translated into many European languages. This authorised translation of the third and final 1849 edition, dating from Humboldt's eightieth year, was published in 1850, though another English translation (by Mrs Sabine) had appeared the previous year. The wide coverage, including geology, geography and biology, is typical of Humboldt, as is the precise and engaging style.},

  abstract = {Aim Recent advances in the availability of species distributional and high- resolution environmental data have facilitated the investigation of species richness\textendash environment relationships. However, even exhaustive distributional databases are prone to geographical sampling bias. We aim to quantify the inventory incompleteness of vascular plant data across 2377 Chinese counties and to test whether inventory incompleteness affects the analysis of richness\textendash{} environment relationships and spatial predictions of species richness. Location China. Methods We used the most comprehensive database of Chinese vascular plants, which includes county-level occurrences for 29,012 native species derived from 4,236,768 specimen and literature records. For each county, we computed smoothed species accumulation curves and used the mean slope of the last 10\% of the curves as a proxy for inventory incompleteness. We created a series of data subsets with different levels of inventory incompleteness by excluding successively more under-sampled counties from the full data set. We then applied spatial and non-spatial regression models to each of these subsets to investigate relationships between the species richness of subsets and environ- mental factors, and to predict spatial patterns of vascular plant species richness in China. Results Log10-transformed numbers of records and documented species were strongly correlated (r = 0.97). In total, 91\% of Chinese counties were identified as under-sampled. After controlling for inventory incompleteness, the overall explanatory power of environmental factors markedly increased, and the strongest predictor of species richness switched from elevational range to annual wet days. Environmental models calibrated with more complete inven- tories yielded better spatial predictions of species richness. Main conclusions Our results indicate that inventory incompleteness strongly affects the explanatory power of environmental factors, the main determinants of species richness obtained from regression analyses, and the reliability of environment-based spatial predictions of species richness. We conclude that even large distributional databases are prone to geographical sampling bias, with far-reaching implications for the perception of and inferences about mac- roecological patterns.},

Understanding the constraints on collecting effort is crucial for identifying potential bias in distributional databases and for making future surveys more efficient. Here we test six competing hypotheses on drivers of geographical variation in collecting effort and identify the main factors shaping the geography of floristic collections in China. Location China. Methods We used the most comprehensive database of Chinese vascular plant distributions including 4,338,516 county-level occurrences derived from herbarium specimens and literature sources. Explanatory variables were assembled representing six different hypotheses: accessibility, human population density, the `botanist effect', mountains, water availability and conservation priority. Ordinary least-squares models with eigenvector-based spatial filters were applied to investigate their effects on spatial patterns of two different facets of collecting effort, i.e. collection density and inventory incompleteness. Results All hypotheses except accessibility and human population density received significant support. Elevational range was the strongest predictor with a positive effect on collection density. Inventory incompleteness in turn was best predicted by human population density, but unexpectedly showed a positive effect. In contrast to previous studies, collecting effort was only weakly and negatively related to road density. Counties with herbaria had significantly higher collecting effort, and the presence of herbaria had weakly positive effects on neighbouring counties. Main conclusions Our results indicate that China's mountains are most intensively and completely collected, whereas densely populated areas are surprisingly under-sampled. Because densely populated areas are more seriously threatened by land-use change, our results show a need to increase biological collections in those areas for conservation assessment and monitoring. More generally, our study suggests that collecting effort and its environmental and socio-economic constraints have a strong region-specific component influenced by cultural context and by different botanical traditions.},
