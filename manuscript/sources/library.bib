We compared such information with a compilation of independent distributional data from natural history collections and other sources. Location Europe. Methods We used data for the hawkmoths (Lepidoptera, family Sphingidae) to assess three aspects of range information: (1) observed range filling in 100 km 9 100 km grid cell squares, (2) observed European range extent and (3) observed climatic niche. Range extents were calculated as products of latitu- dinal and longitudinal extents. Areas derived from minimum convex polygons drawn onto a 2-dimensional niche space representing the two main axes of a principal component analysis (PCA) were used to calculate climatic niche space. Additionally, record-based permutation tests for niche differences were carried out. Results We found that GBIF provided many more distribution records than independent compilation efforts, but contributed less information on range filling, range extent and climatic niches of species. Main conclusions Although GBIF contributed relevant additional information, it is not yet an effective alternative to manual compilation and databasing of distributional records from collections and literature sources, at least in lesser- known taxa such as invertebrates. We discuss possible reasons for our findings, which may help shape GBIF strategies for providing more informative data.},

Here we compile the largest dataset of inventories of small mammal communities for the Neotropical region. The dataset reviews small mammal communities from the Atlantic forest of South America, one of the regions with the highest diversity of small mammals and a global biodiversity hotspot, though currently covering less than 12\% of its original area due to anthropogenic pressures. The dataset comprises 136 references from 300 locations covering seven vegetation types of tropical and subtropical Atlantic forests of South America, and presents data on species composition, richness, and relative abundance (captures/trap-nights). One paper was published more than 70 yr ago, but 80\% of them were published after 2000. The dataset comprises 53,518 individuals of 124 species of small mammals, including 30 species of marsupials and 94 species of rodents. Species richness averaged 8.2 species (1\textendash 21) per site. Only two species occurred in more than 50\% of the sites (the common opossum, Didelphis aurita and black-footed pigmy rice rat Oligoryzomys nigripes). Mean species abundance varied 430-fold, from 4.3 to 0.01 individuals/trap-night. The dataset also revealed a hyper-dominance of 22 species that comprised 78.29\% of all individuals captured, with only seven species representing 44\% of all captures. The information contained on this dataset can be applied in the study of macroecological patterns of biodiversity, communities, and populations, but also to evaluate the ecological consequences of fragmentation and defaunation, and predict disease outbreaks, trophic interactions and community dynamics in this biodiversity hotspot.},

But estimates of species richness for a given place are often imprecise and incomplete, even when derived from expert-validated range maps. The current uptake of citizen science in natural resource management, conservation, and ecology offers great potential for extensive data to define species occurrence and richness patterns in the future. Yet, studies are needed to validate these richness patterns and ensure these data are fit-for-purpose. We compared data from a continental-scale citizen science project\textemdash FrogID\textemdash with expert-derived range maps to assess how well the former predicts species richness patterns in space. We then investigated how many citizen science submissions are necessary to fully sample the underlying frog community. There was a strong positive association between citizen science species richness estimates and estimates derived from an expert-derived map of frog distributions. An average of 153 citizen science submissions were necessary to fully-sample frog richness based on the expert-derived frog richness. Sampling effort in the citizen science project was negatively correlated with the remoteness of an area: less remote areas were more likely to have a greater number of citizen science submissions and be fully sampled. This suggests that scientists will likely need to rely on professionals for data collection in remote regions. We conclude that a citizen science project that has been running for {$\sim$} 18 months, can accurately predict frog species richness at a continental scale compared with an expert-derived map based on {$\sim$} 240 years of data accumulation. At large-scales, biodiversity data derived from citizen science projects will likely play a prominent role in the future of biodiversity and conservation.},

  abstract = {Abstract Primates play an important role in ecosystem functioning and offer critical insights into human evolution, biology, behavior, and emerging infectious diseases. There are 26 primate species in the Atlantic Forests of South America, 19 of them endemic. We compiled a dataset of 5,472 georeferenced locations of 26 native and 1 introduced primate species, as hybrids in the genera Callithrix and Alouatta. The dataset includes 700 primate communities, 8,121 single species occurrences and 714 estimates of primate population sizes, covering most natural forest types of the tropical and subtropical Atlantic Forest of Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina and some other biomes. On average, primate communities of the Atlantic Forest harbor 2 {$\pm$} 1 species (range = 1\textendash 6). However, about 40\% of primate communities contain only one species. Alouatta guariba (N = 2,188 records) and Sapajus nigritus (N = 1,127) were the species with the most records. Callicebus barbarabrownae (N = 35), Leontopithecus caissara (N = 38), and Sapajus libidinosus (N = 41) were the species with the least records. Recorded primate densities varied from 0.004 individuals/km2 (Alouatta guariba at Fragmento do Bugre, Paran\'a, Brazil) to 400 individuals/km2 (Alouatta caraya in Santiago, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil). Our dataset reflects disparity between the numerous primate census conducted in the Atlantic Forest, in contrast to the scarcity of estimates of population sizes and densities. With these data, researchers can develop different macroecological and regional level studies, focusing on communities, populations, species co-occurrence and distribution patterns. Moreover, the data can also be used to assess the consequences of fragmentation, defaunation, and disease outbreaks on different ecological processes, such as trophic cascades, species invasion or extinction, and community dynamics.

These were tested by first examining patterns of species richness of birds, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles in 336 quadrats covering North America. These patterns were then compared with the regional variation of 21 descriptors of the environment suggested by the hypotheses. I found that, in the four vertebrate classes studied, 80\%-93\% of the variability in species richness could be statistically explained by a monotonically increasing function of a single variable: annual potential evapotranspiration (PET). In contrast, tree richness is more closely related to actual evapotranspiration (AET). Both AET and PET appear to be measures of available environmental energy. The relationships between tree and vertebrate richness are strikingly poor. Species richness in particular orders and families of the Vertebrata is also closely related to PET, but not always monotonically, often resembling a replacement series along an environmental gradient. The present results are consistent with the hypothesis that environmentally available energy limits regional species richness. However, my observations are not completely consistent with earlier species-energy theory. The energy-richness relationship appears to depend on scale, and it is affected differently by variations in area and in areal energy flux.},

Location Mediterranean islands. Methods We gathered data on reptile richness from 974 islands, assuming better sampling in islands with specific inventories. We used Moran's eigenvector mapping to analyse the factors that determine whether an island has been surveyed, and to identify the relationships between reptile richness, geographical parameters and anthropic parameters.We simulated islands, mimicking patterns of true data, and sampled them with varying effort. Simulated richness was analysed using the same approach used for real-world data. Results The probability that islands were sampled for reptiles was higher in large, human-populated islands. The relationship between human impact and reptile richness was negative in well-surveyed islands, but positive in islands that had not been systematically surveyed, because densely populated and accessible islands receive better sampling. In simulations, analyses successfully retrieved the relation- ships between species richness and human presence only if the average species detection probability was {$\geq$}75\%. Poorer sampling resulted in biased regression results. Main conclusions Human activities may strongly affect biodiversity, but human presence and accessibility improve sampling effort and thus the quality of biodi- versity information. Therefore, regressing known species richness on parameters representing human presence may result in apparent positive relationships. These two facets of human presence (positive on biodiversity knowledge, negative on actual biodiversity) represent a major challenge for ecogeographical studies, as not taking them into account would bias analyses and underestimate human impact},

Our objectives for compiling these data were to summarize information about inventories of non-volant mammals in the critically important area of the Upper Paran\'a River Basin by focusing on species richness and index of frequency of occurrence and to identify gaps in knowledge regarding non-volant mammal communities in order to guide future sampling efforts. The data set comprises studies on communities of non-volant mammals from 52 locations covering more than 1,000 km2 and comprises portion of four Brazilian states in the Upper Paran\'a River Basin. We listed 81 species of non-volant mammals distributed among 58 genera, 22 families, and 9 orders. Rodentia (28 species) was the richest order, followed by Carnivora (17 spp.) and Didelphimorphia (15 spp.). The richest family was Cricetidae (20 spp.), followed by Didelphidae (15 spp.), and Dasypodidae and Felidae (six spp.). Considering national conservation status, one species are considered endangered and 16 vulnerable. Considering global conservation status, 7 species are considered vulnerable, 10 are considered near threatened, and 6 are data deficient. According to the index of frequency of occurrence, Myrmecophaga tridactyla was the most frequent species, occurring at 88.64\% of all sites, while 25 species were considered very restricted, occurring in just 2.56\% of all sites. In general, the non-volant mammal fauna was composed of mainly very restricted (VR, 25 species) and localized species (L, 25 species), which account for 61.7\% of the known species, while 38.3\% are restricted (R, 8 species), common (C, 16 species), and widespread (W, 7 species). Seven marsupials and five small rodents had their distributions extended in the central-south of Brazil. All of these species are considered data deficient or threatened, which highlights the importance of these records. No copyright restrictions are associated with the use of this data set.

In spite of its importance, ecologists have not always appreciated the effects of abundance and sampling effort on richness measures and comparisons. We survey a series of common pitfalls in quantifying and comparing taxon richness. These pitfalls can be largely avoided by using accumulation and rarefaction curves, which may be based on either individuals or samples. These taxon sampling curves contain the basic information for valid richness comparisons, including category{$\pm$}subcategory ratios (species-to-genus and species-to- individual ratios). Rarefaction methods {$\pm$} both sample-based and individual-based {$\pm$} allow for meaningful standardization and comparison of datasets. Standardizing data sets by area or sampling effort may produce very different results compared to standardizing by number of individuals collected, and it is not always clear which measure of diversity is more appropriate. Asymptotic richness estimators provide lower-bound estimates for taxon-rich groups such as tropical arthropods, in which observed richness rarely reaches an asymptote, despite intensive sampling. Recent examples of diversity studies of tropical trees, stream invertebrates, and herbaceous plants emphasize the importance of carefully quantifying species richness using taxon sampling curves.},

In light of this relatively new and rapidly increasing resource, we critically review its utility and limitations for addressing a diverse array of applications. When integrated with spatial environmental data, NHC data can be used to study a broad range of topics, from aspects of ecological and evolutionary theory, to applications in conservation, agriculture and human health. There are challenges inherent to using NHC data, such as taxonomic inaccuracies and biases in the spatial coverage of data, which require consideration. Promising research frontiers include the integration of NHC data with information from comparative genomics and phylogenetics, and stronger connections between the environmental analysis of NHC data and experimental and field-based tests of hypotheses. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Abstract South America holds 30\% of the world's avifauna, with the Atlantic Forest representing one of the richest regions of the Neotropics. Here we have compiled a data set on Brazilian Atlantic Forest bird occurrence (150,423) and abundance samples (N = 832 bird species; 33,119 bird individuals) using multiple methods, including qualitative surveys, mist nets, point counts, and line transects). We used four main sources of data: museum collections, on-line databases, literature sources, and unpublished reports. The data set comprises 4,122 localities and data from 1815 to 2017. Most studies were conducted in the Florestas de Interior (1,510 localities) and Serra do Mar (1,280 localities) biogeographic sub-regions. Considering the three main quantitative methods (mist net, point count, and line transect), we compiled abundance data for 745 species in 576 communities. In the data set, the most frequent species were Basileuterus culicivorus, Cyclaris gujanensis, and Conophaga lineata. There were 71 singletons, such as Lipaugus conditus and Calyptura cristata. We suggest that this small number of records reinforces the critical situation of these taxa in the Atlantic Forest. The information provided in this data set can be used for macroecological studies and to foster conservation strategies in this biodiversity hotspot. No copyright restrictions are associated with the data set. Please cite this Data Paper if data are used in publications and teaching events.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The accessibility of global biodiversity information has surged in the past two decades, notably through widespread funding initiatives for museum specimen digitization and emergence of large-scale public participation in community science. Effective use of these data requires the integration of disconnected datasets, but the scientific impacts of consolidated biodiversity data networks have not yet been quantified. To determine whether data integration enables novel research, we carried out a quantitative text analysis and bibliographic synthesis of \&gt;4,000 studies published from 2003 to 2019 that use data mediated by the world's largest biodiversity data network, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Data available through GBIF increased 12-fold since 2007, a trend matched by global data use with roughly two publications using GBIF-mediated data per day in 2019. Data-use patterns were diverse by authorship, geographic extent, taxonomic group, and dataset type. Despite facilitating global authorship, legacies of colonial science remain. Studies involving species distribution modeling were most prevalent (31\% of literature surveyed) but recently shifted in focus from theory to application. Topic prevalence was stable across the 17-y period for some research areas (e.g., macroecology), yet other topics proportionately declined (e.g., taxonomy) or increased (e.g., species interactions, disease). Although centered on biological subfields, GBIF-enabled research extends surprisingly across all major scientific disciplines. Biodiversity data mobilization through global data aggregation has enabled basic and applied research use at temporal, spatial, and taxonomic scales otherwise not possible, launching biodiversity sciences into a new era.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

However, despite recent efforts to gather two centuries of biodiversity inventories into comprehensive databases, many crucial research questions remain unanswered. Here, we update the concept of knowledge shortfalls and review the tradeoffs between generality and uncertainty. We present seven key shortfalls of current biodiversity data. Four previously proposed shortfalls pinpoint knowledge gaps for species taxonomy (Linnean), distribution (Wallacean), abundance (Prestonian), and evolutionary patterns (Darwinian). We also redefine the Hutchinsonian shortfall to apply to the abiotic tolerances of species and propose new shortfalls relating to limited knowledge of species traits (Raunki\ae ran) and biotic interactions (Eltonian). We conclude with a general framework for the combined impacts and consequences of shortfalls of large-scale biodiversity knowledge for evolutionary and ecological research and consider ways of overcoming the seven shortfalls and dealing with the uncertainty they generate.},

Here, we conceptualize widely used biodiversity data types according to their domain (what aspect of biodiversity is described?) and informational resolution (how specific is the description?). Applying this framework to major data providers in biodiversity research reveals a strong focus on the disaggregated end of the data spectrum, whereas aggregated data types remain largely underutilized. We discuss the implications of this imbalance for the scope and representativeness of current macroecological research and highlight the synergies arising from a tighter integration of biodiversity data across domains and resolutions. We lay out effective strategies for data collection, mobilization, imputation, and sharing and summarize existing frameworks for scalable and integrative biodiversity research. Finally, we use two case studies to demonstrate how the explicit consideration of data domain and resolution helps to identify biases and gaps in global data sets and achieve unprecedented taxonomic and geographical data coverage in macroecological analyses.},

  abstract = {news and update ISSN 1948-6596 commentary Mapping species distributions: living with uncertainty decreases with time because of range changes associated with factors such as climate and land- use change, habitat degradation, biological inva- sions, etc. Moreover, changes in taxonomic status resulting from reclassifications (Hey et al. 2003) may mean that even if the assemblage remains unchanged, the quality of the information de- grades. Thus, the utility and accuracy of informa- tion about species occurrences to describe current distributions depends upon when the database is consulted. This process of information decay also applies to data based on expert assessments, such as range maps, which are ultimately based on knowledge coming from surveys and observa- tions. Finally, the decay in community similarity with increasing geographic distances is a well known pattern in biogeography (Nekola \& White 1999). The main drivers of this pattern are envi- ronmental gradients (e.g. climate, soil chemistry, etc.), spatial configuration of habitats and popula- tion aggregation (Morlon et al. 2008). Species dis- tribution maps are typically based on the spatial extrapolation of survey data through expert as- sessment or species distribution modeling (Rocchini et al. 2011). It follows that their accu- racy for unsurveyed regions will decrease with distance from the original samples, and (in the absence of comprehensive coverage of the study area) our knowledge about the actual distribution of the species may be poor. The proposed Map of Life project aspires to create a type of omniscient GIS for all the Earth's living species \textendash{} such as the one imagined by Colwell \& Coddington (1994). This is a wonderful target, with the potential to dramatically improve the spatial and temporal resolution of biodiversity data. Nevertheless, the biodiversity data that un- derpin any such enterprise have intrinsic and un- avoidable limitations that result in loss of knowl- edge over both time and space. This is well known A recent paper by Jetz et al. (2012) presents the `Map of Life', a web-based tool that aims to pro- vide a representation of the distribution of every species on Earth 1 . This database, if it is fully real- ized, would provide an invaluable resource for the advancement of biogeographical research, in addi- tion to its potential utility for conservation plan- ning. As most biogeographers, we would give al- most unconditional support to any initiatives that may improve the quantity, quality and availability of species distribution data \textendash{} such as the Map of Life, GBIF 2 , Encyclopedia of Life 3 , etc. (see review in Riddle et al. 2010). We are certain that they will provide a deeper and wider knowledge about life on Earth through the uprising field of biodiversity informatics (see Sober\'on \& Peterson 2004). Even so, it is important to bear in mind that there are intrinsic limitations to the quality, longevity and coverage of biodiversity data. There are at least three factors that com- promise the quality of our knowledge of species distributions at any given spatial scale: survey completeness, and the decay of information with time and space. First, as any field ecologist knows, many taxa are difficult to detect because of their phenotype (cryptic coloration and behavior, high mobility, phenology, etc.) and the characteristics of the habitat. Thus, most biological surveys on which species distribution maps are based are un- avoidably incomplete, even when a range of sam- pling methodologies is utilized (Colwell \& Cod- dington 1994). In other words, it is normally im- possible to record the entire assemblage for a de- fined area at a given moment of time. Moreover, the completeness of a sample will typically de- crease with increasing extent of the survey area (see Chiarucci et al. 2011). Second, knowledge about species distribu- tions and the composition of local assemblages is in a constant state of information decay.

Camera trapping has become a major advance for monitoring terrestrial mammals in biodiversity rich ecosystems. Here we compiled one of the largest datasets of inventories of terrestrial mammal communities for the Neotropical region based on camera trapping studies. The dataset comprises 170 surveys of medium to large terrestrial mammals using camera traps conducted in 144 areas by 74 studies, covering six vegetation types of tropical and subtropical Atlantic Forest of South America (Brazil and Argentina), and present data on species composition and richness. The complete dataset comprises 53,438 independent records of 83 species of mammals, includes 10 species of marsupials, 15 rodents, 20 carnivores, eight ungulates and six armadillos. Species richness averaged 13 species ({$\pm$}6.07 SD) per site. Only six species occurred in more than 50\% of the sites: the domestic dog Canis familiaris, crab-eating fox Cerdocyon thous, tayra Eira barbara, south American coati Nasua nasua, crab-eating raccoon Procyon cancrivorus and the nine-banded armadillo Dasypus novemcinctus. The information contained in this dataset can be used to understand macroecological patterns of biodiversity, community, and population structure, but also to evaluate the ecological consequences of fragmentation, defaunation, and trophic interactions.},

In this study, we explore what hampers dataset retrieval in biodiversity research, a field that produces a large amount of heterogeneous data. In particular, we focus on scholarly search interests and metadata, the primary source of data in a dataset retrieval system. We show that existing metadata currently poorly reflect information needs and therefore are the biggest obstacle in retrieving relevant data. Our findings indicate that for data seekers in the biodiversity domain environments, materials and chemicals, species, biological and chemical processes, locations, data parameters and data types are important information categories. These interests are well covered in metadata elements of domain-specific standards. However, instead of utilizing these standards, large data repositories tend to use metadata standards with domain-independent metadata fields that cover search interests only to some extent. A second problem are arbitrary keywords utilized in descriptive fields such as title, description or subject. Keywords support scholars in a full text search only if the provided terms syntactically match or their semantic relationship to terms used in a user query is known.},

Does local adaptation target the same genes in related species? Do loci responsible for local adaptation exhibit tradeoffs across environments? After discussing these questions we highlight important limitations to population genetic analyses including challenges with obtaining high quality data, deciding which loci are targets of selection, and limits to identifying the genetic basis of local adaptation.},

  abstract = {Abstract Bats are the second most diverse mammal order and they provide vital ecosystem functions (e.g., pollination, seed dispersal, and nutrient flux in caves) and services (e.g., crop pest suppression). Bats are also important vectors of infectious diseases, harboring more than 100 different virus types. In the present study, we compiled information on bat communities from the Atlantic Forests of South America, a species-rich biome that is highly threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation. The ATLANTIC BATS data set comprises 135 quantitative studies carried out in 205 sites, which cover most vegetation types of the tropical and subtropical Atlantic Forest: dense ombrophilous forest, mixed ombrophilous forest, semideciduous forest, deciduous forest, savanna, steppe, and open ombrophilous forest. The data set includes information on more than 90,000 captures of 98 bat species of eight families. Species richness averaged 12.1 per site, with a median value of 10 species (ranging from 1 to 53 species). Six species occurred in more than 50\% of the communities: Artibeus lituratus, Carollia perspicillata, Sturnira lilium, Artibeus fimbriatus, Glossophaga soricina, and Platyrrhinus lineatus. The number of captures divided by sampling effort, a proxy for abundance, varied from 0.000001 to 0.77 individuals{$\cdot$}h-1{$\cdot$}m-2 (0.04 {$\pm$} 0.007 individuals{$\cdot$}h-1{$\cdot$}m-2). Our data set reveals a hyper-dominance of eight species that together that comprise 80\% of all captures: Platyrrhinus lineatus (2.3\%), Molossus molossus (2.8\%), Artibeus obscurus (3.4\%), Artibeus planirostris (5.2\%), Artibeus fimbriatus (7\%), Sturnira lilium (14.5\%), Carollia perspicillata (15.6\%), and Artibeus lituratus (29.2\%).},

  abstract = {The neotropical Atlantic Forest supports one of the highest degrees of species richness and rates of endemism on the planet, but has also undergone a huge forest loss. However, there exists no broad-scale information about the spatial distribution of its remnants that could guide conservation actions, especially when systematic biodiversity data are not available. In this context, our objectives were to quantify how much of the forest still remains, and analyze its spatial distribution. We considered the entire Brazilian Atlantic Forest, and eight sub-regions, defined according to species distribution. The results revealed a serious situation: more than 80\% of the fragments are \textbackslash textless50 ha, almost half the remaining forest is \textbackslash textless100 m from its edges, the average distance between fragments is large (1440 m), and nature reserves protect only 9\% of the remaining forest and 1\% of the original forest. On the other hand, our estimates of existing Atlantic Forest cover were higher than previous ones (7-8\%), ranging from 11.4\% to 16\%. The differences among estimates are mainly related to our inclusion of intermediate secondary forests and small fragments (\textbackslash textless100 ha), which correspond to approximately 32-40\% of what remains. We suggest some guidelines for conservation: (i) large mature forest fragments should be a conservation priority; (ii) smaller fragments can be managed in order to maintain functionally linked mosaics; (iii) the matrix surrounding fragments should be managed so as to minimize edge effects and improve connectivity; and (iv) restoration actions should be taken, particularly in certain key areas. The clear differences in the amount remaining and its spatial distribution within each sub-region must be considered when planning for biodiversity conservation. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the evaluation of data bases requires the incorporation of estimates of sampling effort and bias, no studies have focused on these aspects for freshwater biodiversity data. We used here a comprehensive data base of water beetles from the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands, and examine whether these data provide an unbiased, reliable picture of their diversity and distribution in the study area. Based on theoretical estimates using the Clench function on the accumulated number of records as a surrogate of sampling effort, about a quarter of the Iberian and Balearic 50 x 50 km Universal Transverse Mercator grid cells can be considered well prospected, with more than 70\% of the theoretical species richness actually recorded. These well-surveyed cells are not evenly distributed across biogeographical and physicoclimatic subregions, reflecting some geographical bias in the distribution of sampling effort. Our results suggest that recording was skewed by relatively simple variables affecting collector activity, such as the perceived 'attractiveness' of mountainous landscapes and protected areas with recently described species, and accessibility of sampling sites (distance from main research centres). We emphasize the importance of these evaluation exercises, which are useful to locate areas needed of further sampling as well as to identify potential biases in the distribution of current biodiversity patterns},

Recent efforts within Brazil have assembled a massive amount of such documentation for Brazilian plants, which we analyse in this study. Our aim is to identify areas representing gaps in current knowledge; these gaps can guide future botanical exploration and discovery in Brazil. Location: Brazil. Methods: We assessed angiosperm inventories across Brazil at diverse spatial scales using statistics that summarize inventory completeness. In particular, we assess the completeness of geographical knowledge of Brazilian floras as measured in terms of geographical distance and climatic difference from well-documented sites. Results: Spatial knowledge of Brazilian angiosperms is very unevenly distributed: well-known sites are concentrated in eastern and southern regions, whereas the remainder of the country remains poorly documented. Worse still, in many regions, areas lacking detailed botanical documentation coincide with areas of intense habitat destruction, such that many such sites will never be documented scientifically. Main conclusions: This study illustrates how biodiversity survey and inventory efforts can be guided by existing knowledge. That is, to the extent that existing biodiversity knowledge is made digital and openly available, and to the extent that information is sufficiently comprehensive and informative, spatial summaries of completeness such as that presented here offer clear and strategic directions for maximizing the yield of new knowledge from any de novo field efforts. \textcopyright{} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

Here, we present the ATLANTIC MAMMALS, an open data set on information on medium- and large-sized mammal assemblages in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. A total of 129 studies were compiled, including published and in press peer-reviewed papers, book chapters, theses and unpublished data. We mapped 244 assemblages, eight orders, 63 genera, and 94 species (24 of which are classified as threatened by the IUCN Red List) distributed in 128 protected and 116 unprotected areas. Species richness of the mammalian assemblages varied from 1 to 39 species (mean 15). The most recorded species in the entire biome was Dasypus novemcinctus, followed by Cerdocyon thous and Procyon cancrivorous. These data can be useful in support of macroecological studies and conservation planning strategies. Please cite this data paper when the data are used in publications.

In this paper we present an innovative use of the Internet and information technologies that better enhances the opportunity for citizens to contribute their observations to science and the conservation of bird populations. eBird is building a web-enabled community of bird watchers who collect, manage, and store their observations in a globally accessible unified database. Through its development as a tool that addresses the needs of the birding community, eBird sustains and grows participation. Birders, scientists, and conservationists are using eBird data worldwide to better understand avian biological patterns and the environmental and anthropogenic factors that influence them. Developing and shaping this network over time, eBird has created a near real-time avian data resource producing millions of observations per year.},

While the effects of biased spatial coverage of biodiversity data are relatively well known, temporal variation in data quality (i.e., the congruence between recorded and actual information) has received much less attention. Here, we develop a conceptual framework for understanding the influence of time on biodiversity data quality based on three main processes: (1) the natural dynamics of ecological systems\textemdash such as species turnover or local extinction; (2) periodic taxonomic revisions, and; (3) the loss of physical and metadata due to inefficient curation, accidents, or funding shortfalls. Temporal decay in data quality driven by these three processes has fundamental consequences for the usage and comparability of data collected in different time periods. Data decay can be partly ameliorated by adopting standard protocols for generation, storage, and sharing data and metadata. However, some data degradation is unavoidable due to natural variations in ecological systems. Consequently, changes in biodiversity data quality over time need be carefully assessed and, if possible, taken into account when analyzing aging datasets.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diversity patterns of different taxa typically covary in space, a phenomenon called cross-taxon congruence. This pattern has been explained by the effect of one taxon diversity on taxon diversity, shared biogeographic histories of different taxa, and/or common responses to environmental conditions. A meta-analysis of the association between environment and diversity patterns found that in 83 out of 85 studies, more than 60\% of the spatial variability in species richness was related to variables representing energy, water or their interaction. The role of the environment determining taxa diversity patterns leads us to hypothesize that this would explain the observed cross-taxon congruence. However, recent analyses reported the persistence of cross-taxon congruence when environmental effect was statistically removed. Here we evaluate this hypothesis, analyzing the cross-taxon congruence between birds and mammals in the Brazilian Cerrado, and assess the environmental role on the spatial covariation in diversity patterns. RESULTS: We found a positive association between avian and mammal richness and a positive latitudinal trend for both groups in the Brazilian Cerrado. Regression analyses indicated an effect of latitude, PET, and mean temperature over both biological groups. In addition, we show that NDVI was only associated with avian diversity; while the annual relative humidity, was only correlated with mammal diversity. We determined the environmental effects on diversity in a path analysis that accounted for 73\% and 76\% of the spatial variation in avian and mammal richness. However, an association between avian and mammal diversity remains significant. Indeed, the importance of this link between bird and mammal diversity was also supported by a significant association between birds and mammal spatial autoregressive model residuals. CONCLUSION: Our study corroborates the main role of environmental conditions on diversity patterns, but suggests that other important mechanisms, which have not been properly evaluated, are involved in the observed cross-taxon congruence. The approaches introduced here indicate that the prevalence of a significant association among taxa, after considering the environmental determinant, could indicate both the need to incorporate additional processes (e.g. biogeographic and evolutionary history or trophic interactions) and/or the existence of a shared trend in detection biases among taxa and regions.},

  abstract = {Abstract Amphibians are among the most threatened vertebrates in the world and this is also true for those inhabiting the Atlantic Forest hotspot, living in ecosystems that are highly degraded and threatened by anthropogenic activities. We present a data set containing information about amphibian communities sampled throughout the Atlantic Forest Biome in South America. The data were extracted from 389 bibliographic references (articles, books, theses, and dissertations) representing inventories of amphibian communities from 1940 to 2017. The data set includes 17,619 records of 528 species with taxonomic certainty, from 1,163 study sites. Of all the records, 14,450 (82\%) were classified using the criterion of endemism; of those, 7,787 (44\%) were considered endemic and 6,663 (38\%) were not. Historically, multiple sampling methods were used to survey amphibians, the most representative methods being active surveys (82.1\%), surveys at breeding sites (20\%), pitfall traps (15.3\%), and occasional encounters (14.5\%). Species richness averaged 15.2 {$\pm$} 11.3 (mean {$\pm$} SD), ranging from 1 to 80 species per site. We found a low dominance in the communities, with 10 species occurring in about 26\% of communities: Physalaemus cuvieri (4.1\%), Dendropsophus minutus (3.8\%), Boana faber (3.1\%), Scinax fuscovarius (2.8\%), Leptodactylus latrans (2.7\%), Leptodactylus fuscus (2.6\%), Boana albopunctata (2.3\%), Dendropsophus nanus (1.6\%), Rhinella ornata (1.6\%), and Leptodactylus mystacinus (1.6\%). This data set represents a major effort to compile inventories of amphibian communities for the Neotropical region, filling a large gap in the data on the Atlantic Forest hotspot. We hope this data set can be used as a credible tool in the proposal of new studies on amphibian sampling and even in the development of conservation planning for these taxa. This information also has great relevance for macroecological studies, being foundational for both conservation and restoration strategies in this biodiversity hotspot.

  abstract = {Anurans are a highly diverse group in the Atlantic Forest hotspot (AF), yet distribution patterns and species richness gradients are not randomly distributed throughout the biome. Thus, we explore how anuran species are distributed in this complex and biodiverse hotspot, and hypothesize that this group can be distinguished by different cohesive regions. We used range maps of 497 species to obtain a presence/absence data grid, resolved to 50\texttimes 50 km grain size, which was submitted to k-means clustering with v-fold cross-validation to determine the biogeographic regions. We also explored the extent to which current environmental variables, topography, and floristic structure of the AF are expected to identify the cluster patterns recognized by the k-means clustering. The biogeographic patterns found for amphibians are broadly congruent with ecoregions identified in the AF, but their edges, and sometimes the whole extent of some clusters, present much less resolved pattern compared to previous classification. We also identified that climate, topography, and vegetation structure of the AF explained a high percentage of variance of the cluster patterns identified, but the magnitude of the regression coefficients shifted regarding their importance in explaining the variance for each cluster. Specifically, we propose that the anuran fauna of the AF can be split into four biogeographic regions: a) less diverse and widely-ranged species that predominantly occur in the inland semideciduous forests; b) northern small-ranged species that presumably evolved within the Pleistocene forest refugia; c) highly diverse and small-ranged species from the southeastern Brazilian mountain chain and its adjacent semideciduous forest; and d) southern species from the Araucaria forest. Finally, the high congruence among the cluster patterns and previous eco-regions identified for the AF suggests that preserving the underlying habitat structure helps to preserve the historical and ecological signals that underlie the geographic distribution of AF anurans.},

  abstract = {Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859) was an intellectual giant: an explorer who helped lay the foundations of biogeography, a naturalist who influenced Charles Darwin, and a botanist who developed a model of the Earth's climate zones. He travelled extensively in Europe, carried out scientific explorations across the Russian Empire and in Latin America, and devoted much energy to seeking a unified view of the different branches of scientific knowledge. Ansichten der Natur, published in 1808 with a second edition in 1826, aimed to 'engage the imagination' as well as to communicate new ideas, and was translated into many European languages. This authorised translation of the third and final 1849 edition, dating from Humboldt's eightieth year, was published in 1850, though another English translation (by Mrs Sabine) had appeared the previous year. The wide coverage, including geology, geography and biology, is typical of Humboldt, as is the precise and engaging style.},

  abstract = {Aim Recent advances in the availability of species distributional and high- resolution environmental data have facilitated the investigation of species richness\textendash environment relationships. However, even exhaustive distributional databases are prone to geographical sampling bias. We aim to quantify the inventory incompleteness of vascular plant data across 2377 Chinese counties and to test whether inventory incompleteness affects the analysis of richness\textendash{} environment relationships and spatial predictions of species richness. Location China. Methods We used the most comprehensive database of Chinese vascular plants, which includes county-level occurrences for 29,012 native species derived from 4,236,768 specimen and literature records. For each county, we computed smoothed species accumulation curves and used the mean slope of the last 10\% of the curves as a proxy for inventory incompleteness. We created a series of data subsets with different levels of inventory incompleteness by excluding successively more under-sampled counties from the full data set. We then applied spatial and non-spatial regression models to each of these subsets to investigate relationships between the species richness of subsets and environ- mental factors, and to predict spatial patterns of vascular plant species richness in China. Results Log10-transformed numbers of records and documented species were strongly correlated (r = 0.97). In total, 91\% of Chinese counties were identified as under-sampled. After controlling for inventory incompleteness, the overall explanatory power of environmental factors markedly increased, and the strongest predictor of species richness switched from elevational range to annual wet days. Environmental models calibrated with more complete inven- tories yielded better spatial predictions of species richness. Main conclusions Our results indicate that inventory incompleteness strongly affects the explanatory power of environmental factors, the main determinants of species richness obtained from regression analyses, and the reliability of environment-based spatial predictions of species richness. We conclude that even large distributional databases are prone to geographical sampling bias, with far-reaching implications for the perception of and inferences about mac- roecological patterns.},

  abstract = {Aim Effort in collecting biodiversity information often varies strongly in space and may be driven by environmental, cultural and socio-economic factors. Understanding the constraints on collecting effort is crucial for identifying potential bias in distributional databases and for making future surveys more efficient. Here we test six competing hypotheses on drivers of geographical variation in collecting effort and identify the main factors shaping the geography of floristic collections in China. Location China. Methods We used the most comprehensive database of Chinese vascular plant distributions including 4,338,516 county-level occurrences derived from herbarium specimens and literature sources. Explanatory variables were assembled representing six different hypotheses: accessibility, human population density, the `botanist effect', mountains, water availability and conservation priority. Ordinary least-squares models with eigenvector-based spatial filters were applied to investigate their effects on spatial patterns of two different facets of collecting effort, i.e. collection density and inventory incompleteness. Results All hypotheses except accessibility and human population density received significant support. Elevational range was the strongest predictor with a positive effect on collection density. Inventory incompleteness in turn was best predicted by human population density, but unexpectedly showed a positive effect. In contrast to previous studies, collecting effort was only weakly and negatively related to road density. Counties with herbaria had significantly higher collecting effort, and the presence of herbaria had weakly positive effects on neighbouring counties. Main conclusions Our results indicate that China's mountains are most intensively and completely collected, whereas densely populated areas are surprisingly under-sampled. Because densely populated areas are more seriously threatened by land-use change, our results show a need to increase biological collections in those areas for conservation assessment and monitoring. More generally, our study suggests that collecting effort and its environmental and socio-economic constraints have a strong region-specific component influenced by cultural context and by different botanical traditions.},
